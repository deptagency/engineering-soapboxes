This is meant to be a set of living documents that we at Dept Engineering collaborate on.

If you're a client, and want to see something in here, please submit an issue and we'll address it!

If you're a Dept engineer and if you think something should be changed in here, submit an issue or submit a pull request.

Rules of engagement:

1. The main README.md file should be Dept Engineering wide recommendations and avoid specific technology recommendations.
1. Anyone in Dept Engineering can submit a Soapbox for a particular topic. Be sure to:
   1. Add a link to the appropriate category (or add a new one if necessary)
   1. Credit yourself along with your github handle
   1. Name your file after your github handle
1. Be respectful and open minded when submitting issues, providing feedback or providing contributions.
1. Remember, this is _public content_ that will reflect on Dept. We want it to be polished, thoughtful and respectful.
1. Strong opinions, loosely held. This is a gathering of our collective recommendations, but if something is hotly contested _we should acknowledge it_ and consider just saying "We haven't come to a conclusion on which is better" and provide both sides of the argument.
1. Recommend _practices_, not _tools_. Say: "Write automated tests using a well supported framework (eg: Jest)." rather than "Use Jest for automated testing." This advice is unlikely to become outdated and doesn't get people's hackles up.
1. Don't contribute for _completeness sake_. This project will never be complete. Contribute things instead that are original and helpful.
